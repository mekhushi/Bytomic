**Transform your resource-intensive models into lean, mean, inference machines.** Bytomic empowers you to compress your AI models into blazing-fast 8-bit and 4-bit versions without sacrificing accuracy. Deploy on edge devices, accelerate inference, and conquer resource limitations.

## Key Benefits

*   **Extreme Compression:** Achieve up to 75% reduction in model size, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices.
*   **Inference Acceleration:** Experience significant speed improvements in inference time, boosting application performance.
*   **Memory Footprint Reduction:** Minimize memory usage, allowing for efficient execution on devices with limited memory.
*   **Hardware Agnostic:** Seamlessly deploy compressed models across diverse hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs and edge devices.
*   **Simplified Deployment Pipeline:** Streamline the deployment process with smaller, more manageable models, reducing complexity and costs.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mekhushi/Bytomic.git
    cd Bytomic
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start

1.  **Compress your model using the command line:**

    ```bash
    python main.py --model gpt2 --mode 8bit
    ```

    *   `--model`: Specifies the model to compress (e.g., gpt2).
    *   `--mode`: Specifies the compression mode (e.g., 8bit).

2.  **Load and use the compressed model in your Python code:**

    ```python
    from main import load_model

    compressed_model = load_model("path/to/your/compressed/model.pth") # Replace with the actual path

    
    input_data = "This is some example text."

    
    output = compressed_model(input_data)

  
    print(output)
    ```

## Core Features

*   **Intelligent Quantization:** Employs advanced quantization algorithms to minimize accuracy degradation during the compression process, ensuring high performance.
*   **Layer-Wise Compression Control:** Provides fine-grained control over compression levels for individual layers, allowing for customized optimization strategies.
*   **Cross-Platform Hardware Acceleration:** Optimizes compressed models for deployment across various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized edge devices.
*   **Intuitive API:** Offers a simple and user-friendly API for seamless integration into existing machine learning workflows, reducing development time.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation & Examples:** Includes detailed documentation and practical examples to facilitate quick adoption and effective utilization of Bytomic.
