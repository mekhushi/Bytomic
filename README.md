## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mekhushi/Bytomic.git
    cd Bytomic
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start

1.  **Compress your model using the command line:**

    ```bash
    python main.py --model gpt2 --mode 8bit
    ```

    *   `--model`: Specifies the model to compress (e.g., gpt2).
    *   `--mode`: Specifies the compression mode (e.g., 8bit).

2.  **Load and use the compressed model in your Python code:**

    ```python
    from main import load_model

    # Load the compressed model
    compressed_model = load_model("path/to/your/compressed/model.pth") # Replace with the actual path

    # Prepare input data
    input_data = "This is some example text."

    # Use the compressed model for inference
    output = compressed_model(input_data)

    # Print the output
    print(output)
    ```
