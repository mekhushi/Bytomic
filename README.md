## Key Benefits

*   **Extreme Compression:** Reduce model size by up to 75% with minimal performance impact.
*   **Blazing-Fast Inference:** Accelerate inference speeds on resource-constrained devices.
*   **Memory Optimization:** Drastically lower memory footprint for efficient deployment.
*   **Hardware Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrate with existing hardware and software infrastructure.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** Streamline the deployment process with smaller, more manageable models.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mekhushi/Bytomic.git
    cd Bytomic
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start

```python
from main import compress_model, load_model, save_model

# 1. Load your pre-trained model
model = load_model("path/to/your/model.pth")

# 2. Compress the model to 8-bit precision
compressed_model = compress_model(model, precision=8)

# 3. Save the compressed model
save_model(compressed_model, "path/to/compressed/model_8bit.pth")

# 4. Load and use the compressed model for inference
loaded_compressed_model = load_model("path/to/compressed/model_8bit.pth")
predictions = loaded_compressed_model(input_data)
```

## Core Features

*   **Intelligent Quantization:** Advanced quantization techniques to minimize accuracy loss during compression.
*   **Layer-Wise Compression:** Fine-grained control over compression levels for individual layers.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Optimized for deployment on various hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, Edge).
*   **Easy-to-Use API:** Simple and intuitive API for seamless integration into existing workflows.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.
